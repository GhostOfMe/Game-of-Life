			+ "possible states, alive or dead, or \"populated\" or \"unpopulated\". "
			+ "Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells "
			+ "that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each "
			+ "step in time, the following transitions occur:"
			+ "\n\n"
			+ "\t 1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if "
			+ "caused by underpopulation.\n"
			+ "\t 2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to "
			+ "the next generation.\n"
			+ "\t 3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as "
			+ "if by overpopulation.\n"
			+ "\t 4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a "
			+ "live cell, as if by reproduction. "
			+ "\n\n"
			+ "The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first "
			+ "generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously "
			+ "to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, "
			+ "and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called "
			+ "a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the "
			+ "preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to "
			+ "create further generations.";
